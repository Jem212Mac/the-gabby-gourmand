## About
This is a website intended to provide interested parties with a review of various restaurants.  The intended user of the site is someone who is interested in food (a foodie) who loves to dine out but also likes to cook and try new recipes.  The home page for the site provides the user with a list of restaurant reviews that they can look through to help them decide on where to dine out next, but the site also includes a page listing food recipes and a page listing cocktail recipes where users can leave comments.

## UX Design
The target audience for the site are foodies that potentially love to travel, to eat, and to cook and make cocktails.  They will likely be cultured and sophisticated people, and as such I wanted to style the site with a clean, clear, uncluttered and sophisticated design with a colour scheme that makes the site feel modern and tasteful.  As such I chose a fairly muted colour pallete with mostly black, white and grey, but with an occasional pop of colour coming from pink headings and buttons.  I also felt that this would provide the ideal backdrop for the colourful plates of food and cocktails that would be displayed in featured images.  At the outset of the project, I created the following wireframe designs using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/):

## Database Scheme

The planning and design of the wireframes helped me to decide on the database schema I would need, and this was created using [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/), as shown below:
